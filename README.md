# Song Popularity Predictive Model

A machine learning project that predicts song popularity using data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

## 📋 Description

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive model for determining song popularity. The project was developed as part of an academic assignment and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model implementation.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Combined_Report_AbdulAzeemSyed. ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, model development, and results
- `song_data.csv` - Dataset containing song features and popularity metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need: 
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common data science libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AzeemSyed123/song-popularity-predictive-mode.git
cd song-popularity-predictive-mode
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Combined_Report_AbdulAzeemSyed.ipynb
```

## 📊 Dataset

The `song_data.csv` file contains various features of songs that are used to predict their popularity, including:
- Audio features (tempo, key, loudness, etc.)
- Song metadata
- Popularity metrics
